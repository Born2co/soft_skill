>tsc test.ts
>tsc test.ts --out output-script.js            (it will change test.ts file to output-script.js)
>tsc test.ts --out output-script.js --watch   (this command will watch the changes in test.ts and automatically update the same on output-script.js when we ll save)


  "outDir": "./out*",                        /* Redirect output structure to the directory. */
  js file after compilation ll save to out folder (here i have created out folder to save all java script file)
  
   "noEmitOnError": true,                        /* Do not emit outputs. */
     (if there is error in typescript file it ll not genrate js file after compilation)
